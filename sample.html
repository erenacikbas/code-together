        The envelope was addressed in a bold sprawling hand that barely left
        room for the seventy-five cent special delivery stamp in the upper right
        hand corner. It was a nice stamp&mdash;a blue one commemorating the
        fiftieth anniversary of Harvey's first landing on Mars. Carl Keating
        tore it open. Inside was a single sheet of good paper, typewritten on
        one side. The message read:
      </p>

      <p class="ph1">
        Dear Mr. Keating;<br />
        Must see you at once.<br />
        Norman Hamlin
      </p>

      <p>
        He'd barely slid the letter back in its wrapper when the desk phone
        rang. Automatically he pushed the view-plate to a respectful fifteen
        inches and threw in the video. The screen swirled for a moment in a
        milky blur, then abruptly a man's head and shoulders jumped into focus.
        He was a lean, angular-faced man, with thin shoulders and thinner lips,
        which at the moment were set in a Lincolnish smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        "I'm Dr. Hamlin," the face in the screen announced. "You got my letter?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Carl nodded. "I have your letter doctor, but I'm afraid you have the
        wrong man. I can't imagine what you'd want to see ME about."
      </p>

      <p>
        The image on the screen expanded as Norman Hamlin leaned toward the
        view-plate. "You are Major Carl Keating, retired?" the mouth asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        Carl pushed the instrument back hoping the other man would do the same.
        "Retired as of last Tuesday," he said, "at the tender age of thirty-six.
        What's on your mind, doctor?"
      </p>

      <p>
        The mouth got bigger till it filled the entire screen. "Major Keating,
        would it be possible for you to come out to Long Island tonight?"
      </p>

      <p>"It would not!"</p>

      <p>"Please it's...."</p>

      <p>
        "Dr. Hamlin," Carl said not bothering to keep the annoyance out of his
        voice, "in the first place I don't even know who you are; in the second
        place I'm packing for a vacation in Paris; and in the third place if
        there's anything I detest, it's talking down someone's throat. Now if
        you don't mind...."
      </p>

      <p>
        "Wait!" The image on the screen diminished, till over the narrow
        shoulders Carl could make out a book-lined study, and beyond that a
        sunken living room. "It's important&mdash;very important."
      </p>

      <p>"So's my vacation."</p>

      <p>"Suppose I were to make it worth while to postpone your vacation?"</p>

      <p>
        "I'm afraid my while is worth more than you could offer," Keating said
        bluntly.
      </p>

      <p>
        "I can offer five thousand dollars," Norman Hamlin said. "It's yours
        just for coming out to Wading River tonight and listening to what I have
        to say."
      </p>

      <p>
        "You mean you'll pay five thousand dollars just for the privilege of
        talking to me?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Hamlin nodded. "You listen to what I tell you. Then, if you aren't
        interested, you pick up your five thousand and leave. It's as easy as
        that."
      </p>

      <p>
        Keating reached across the desk and scanned the envelope. "I have the
        address," he said. "I'll be right out."
      </p>

      <hr class="tb" />

      <p>
        It was the peak of the rush hour when he left the apartment. Overhead, a
        congested swarm of copter traffic buzzed like an angry beehive. A block
        away was a monorail kiosk. Ever conscious of the strange feel of his new
        civvies, Keating entered it and boarded a Huntington express. From there
        it was only ten minutes to Wading River by copter-cab. Dr. Hamlin had
        left the lawn lights burning, and even before he'd paid his fare, was
        standing at his elbow. He extended a hand in greeting. "You made good
        time," he said.
      </p>

      <p>Keating gripped the other man's hand. "You made a good offer."</p>

      <p>
        Hamlin gestured him through an opening in the dura-glass ell of the
        house. The room was a library, the same one he'd seen over Hamlin's
        shoulder during the phone conversation. In the center of the
        book-bordered room was a rectangular table. A man sat at the head of it.
      </p>

      <p>"Sit down," the man said.</p>

      <p>
        Carl sat down. The man at the head of the table was robust, almost to
        the point of flabbiness. He was probably in his late twenties, but the
        pink flush on his cheekbones and a pair of broad-arched eyebrows gave
        him a mannequin appearance.
      </p>

      <p>"This is Mr. Stewart Ferguson," Dr. Hamlin announced.</p>

      <p>"Not THE Mr. Stewart Ferguson?"</p>

      <p>"I take it then you've heard of him?"</p>

      <p>
        Carl studied the man whimsically. "Yeah, I've heard of him," he said.
        "All the way from here to Mars and back I've heard of him."
      </p>

      <p>
        Stewart Ferguson lit a cigarette. "Am I to understand, Mr. Keating, that
        you don't approve of my so-called behavior?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Carl shrugged. "Who am I to comment on your behavior? If I had your
        money I'd probably act the same way you do. Who doesn't want to sleep
        with a video actress?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr. Hamlin coughed. "There are times when perhaps the newspapers have
        exaggerated Mr. Ferguson's escapades. Furthermore, I hardly think his
        private life is any concern of ours."
      </p>

      <p>
        "I'm not concerned," Carl said. "If I'm being paid five thousand dollars
        to listen to an evening's chatter I'd as soon listen to Ferguson's
        autobiography as anything else ... might even come down on my price a
        bit."
      </p>

      <p>
        Stewart Ferguson dug into his coat pocket and came up with a sheaf of
        bills. He threw them across the table. "That takes care of our
        agreement," he said, "now suppose we get down to the business you're
        being paid to listen to."
      </p>

      <p>
        Carl picked up the bills and rapped them across his knuckles. For just a
        moment he toyed with the idea of throwing them back in the playboy's
        face. He didn't. Not only was five thousand dollars a lot of money, but
        his curiosity was aroused. "I'm listening," he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Norman Hamlin braced his bony elbows on the table and leaned toward him.
        "Mr. Keating, in the course of the three trips you made to Mars with the
        military, what was it that stood out foremost in your mind?"
      </p>

      <p>
        "Men's emotions vary," Carl said carefully. "An architect would probably
        admire the beauty of the Martian cities, while a gourmet would savor the
        taste of candied encoms. Probably the thing that impressed me most was
        the friendliness of the people."
      </p>

      <p>
        Hamlin drummed his fingers on the table. "I see," he said. "You'd say,
        then, it was a reasonably nice place to live?"
      </p>

      <p>
        "Reasonably nice," Carl agreed. "Certainly nicer than the
        science-fiction writers had pictured it."
      </p>

      <p>"Better than Earth?"</p>

      <p>
        Carl shook his head. "Not as far as I'm concerned. My tastes run to
        sandy beaches and women with real eyelashes. That's just my personal
        opinion you understand. There's almost eighty-thousand people who
        disagree with me&mdash;I believe that was the latest migration figures."
      </p>

      <p>
        Hamlin thumped his pipe against the edge of the table. "I understand
        you've just returned from Venus, Mr. Keating. Can you give us a short
        briefing concerning your reactions to that planet?"
      </p>

      <hr class="tb" />

      <p>
        Carl eyed the man warily. "I'll be as brief as possible. There's been
        four landings on Venus in almost forty years. All these have been made
        by the military. That to me is a pretty substantial indication that no
        one would go there unless they were ordered to!"
      </p>

      <p>
        Hamlin smiled. "I didn't mean quite as brief as that, Mr. Keating. I had
        rather hoped you'd be a little more explicit."
      </p>

      <p>
        Carl frowned. "I find it a bit hard to understand just what you're
        driving at Dr. Hamlin. After all, there's been over a hundred books
        written on the subject. What can I add to the books? Maybe I could cram
        in a few more ghastly adjectives, but even then it wouldn't explain what
        the place was really like. You'd have to go there to find that out.
      </p>

      <p>
        "How can you explain to someone sitting in a comfortable drawing room,
        the terrors of plodding through a swamp, knee deep in green fog, and
        wondering when a forty foot reptile is going to sink its teeth into your
        leg. How can you explain the sheer mental fatigue of waiting for a
        needle-nosed scorpion to puncture your space jumper, knowing that the
        atmosphere right on the other side of your face-plate can kill you in
        thirty seconds. How do you explain an atmosphere of chlorine and ammonia
        for that matter&mdash;or a color. I say purple-brown to you and it don't
        mean a thing. But look at the angry purple-brown landscape of Venus for
        two years like I did and you'd know what I mean.
      </p>

      <p>
        "It's a primitive planet, Dr. Hamlin. Right now, according to the
        geologists, Venus is just like the earth was ten million years ago. Life
        is forming on it&mdash;primitive life. Take the chowls, for
        example&mdash;you see replicas of them in every department store window.
        They look a little like teddy-bears, especially when they walk. Still
        they have ten fingers and ten toes. Archeologists tell us they're
        humanoid. Yet only half-a-million years ago they crawled out of the
        oceans. Maybe in another two million years they'll be living in houses
        instead of thatched hovels and pointing guns at people instead of
        running like a star-bound flame-buggy every time they hear a noise. But
        right now they're scared. They're out of their natural element and
        they're scared, the same way our own Neanderthal man was scared before
        he found out how to fashion a rock-hammer."
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr. Hamlin lit his pipe. "You're quite sure then, Mr. Keating, that man
        will never be able to live there?"
      </p>

      <p>
        "Live there! Man can't even breathe there! There's less than one tenth
        of one percent oxygen in the air."
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr. Hamlin pressed his fingertips together. "Mr. Keating," he said,
        "just how much do you know about the three men who were lost on the
        first Venus expedition?"
      </p>

      <p>
        "Only what's in the history books," Carl said. "It's more or less of a
        legend, how Edgerton, Rhind, and Mitchell, were separated from the main
        party and never seen again."
      </p>

      <p>
        "Died contributing to man's conquest of space," Ferguson said with mock
        drama.
      </p>

      <p>"It wasn't a pleasant death," Carl said quickly. "I'd bet on that."</p>

      <p>
        "Mr. Keating," Hamlin said, "do you have any ideas as to just why these
        three men should have disappeared at this time?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Carl shook his head. "Could have been anything, I guess. They could have
        got lost and ran out of oxygen. They could have gotten snake bit. I
        wouldn't know. The whole thing happened before I was born."
      </p>

      <hr class="chap" />

      <p class="ph1">II</p>

      <p>
        Dr. Hamlin got up. "No, there was more to it than that. In spite of the
        fact that it happened almost forty years ago, I happen to know that the
        situation didn't occur exactly as the history books would have you
        believe. The army, it is true covered up for them and made them heroes,
        but Edgerton, Mitchell, and Rhind, in reality, took off on their own.
        They took off without orders or permission, just a few hours before
        take-off-time, with nothing except a six week supply of oxygen, a
        portable air-blister, and a few supplies."
      </p>

      <p>
        Carl studied the man's face. The story was true. In his cadet days, old
        spacemen had spilled the story too many times for him to doubt its
        authenticity. "Suppose you tell me what all this is getting at?" he
        hedged.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hamlin crossed the room. From a desk drawer he removed a palm-sized
        photo-cartridge and inserted it in the video adaptor. The room lights
        dimmed as the three dimensional screen brightened, dancing in a
        kaleidoscope of color. The colors merged.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was staring into a vivid reproduction of a Venusian landscape. The
        picture had been taken from a small hill. Below was the violet-brown
        monotony of a saroo forest, visible only in small islands, where the
        roof of the trees stabbed out from the swirling green fog. And beyond
        that, almost lost in the haze, was the outline of a pair of
        reddish-brown spires, that reared out of the jungle, rising, till they
        were lost in the ever present layer of upper clouds that shrouded the
        planet. It was an ugly scene&mdash;ugly, yet strangely beautiful.
      </p>

      <p>
        The camera swiveled in a 180&deg; arc. They were looking up the hill
        now&mdash;looking up to where the hill tore itself loose from the
        green-fog level, rising for perhaps half a mile, then disappearing in
        the white ocean overhead. Halfway up the hill was a cluster of flare
        trees, their purple-brown leaves drooping in the ammonia-soaked air, and
        underneath the trees, a house&mdash;not the blister-type oxygen tents
        used by the military, or the thatched hovels of the chowls, but a real
        earth-style house with a peaked roof and pillar supported porch.
        Abruptly, the picture widened into a sharp closeup, revealing an open
        doorway. A man&mdash;an earthman&mdash;stood framed in the threshold. He
        was a clean-shaven man, probably in his early twenties. Two other men
        slightly older, lolled in a pair of rustic chairs set on the open
        veranda. Apparently none of the men were aware of the camera that
        recorded their every move.
      </p>

      <p>
        Carl was aware of his hands gripping the chair arms. Except for the
        weird backdrop of flare trees and raton vines that flanked the house, he
        might have been looking at a peaceful summer resort in the Canadian
        Rockies. But it wasn't an earth picture. These men were on Venus lolling
        about in their shirt sleeves and breathing in the atmosphere of chlorine
        and ammonia that was sure to kill a man in thirty seconds!
      </p>

      <p>
        It was trick photography. It had to be. Quickly, he flicked a look at
        Dr. Hamlin, then looked back at the screen. One of the men was elbowing
        himself out of the chair now. He walked to the edge of the porch railing
        and stared directly into the camera. There was something vaguely
        familiar about the man&mdash;about all the men.
      </p>

      <p>
        Suddenly, Carl tensed forward on the edge of the chair, conscious of a
        cold icicle of movement that snaked the length of his spine. The picture
        on the screen flicked out, abruptly. The room lights were on again, and
        Stewart Ferguson was studying him with detached insolence.
      </p>

      <p>"Well?" Ferguson asked.</p>

      <p>
        Carl ignored him, and turned to Norman Hamlin. "Did I see what I think I
        saw?" he asked.
      </p>

      <p>Hamlin nodded.</p>

      <p>"But those men!"</p>

      <p>"You recognized them?"</p>

      <p>
        Carl swallowed, hard. The highball he'd had three hours before churned
        up in his throat. "Of course I recognize them," he said thickly.
        "They've been commemorated on postage stamps and cut in stone at every
        spaceport in the country. But they're dead! Been dead for forty years!"
      </p>

      <p>Hamlin turned up his palms. "You saw the pictures," he said evenly.</p>

      <p>
        "Possibly the military has been deceiving us for forty years," Ferguson
        drawled. "Maybe they only made up that story about the poisonous
        atmosphere."
      </p>

      <p>
        Keating felt a hot flush rise to the back of his neck. "That's not
        true," he said with obvious restraint. "I was there&mdash;for two long
        years I was on Venus, and it's bad, every bit as bad as the army says it
        is. You'd have to smell the stuff yourself to know what I really mean.
        It's so bad that even after you drop your jumper in the airlock and
        shower, the stuff follows you inside and stinks the ship up from here to
        Pluto and back again. The army's not lying. Not about that they're not!"
      </p>

      <p>"How do you account for the photos then?"</p>

      <p>
        "I don't know," Carl said wearily. "All I know is that for forty years,
        no man...." He stopped suddenly, as all at once the full enormity of the
        situation dawned on him. Those men on the screen. He'd recognized them
        of course from their pictures. But how about those pictures? The
        pictures he'd seen of Edgerton, Mitchell, and Rhind, were old
        pictures.... Pictures taken almost forty years ago!
      </p>

      <hr class="tb" />

      <p>
        As if from far away, Hamlin's voice was droning in his ears. "Perhaps
        it's not quite as ridiculous as you may think, Mr. Keating. There's a
        widely recognized theory that the very air which gives us life, also
        gives us death. In fact, one of the chief reasons for the high migration
        to Mars is the fact that man's life expectancy on that planet is almost
        thirty percent greater than on our own. Now let's suppose that the three
        men who deserted the first Venus expedition had in some way found a way
        to breathe the air of that planet. Is it so inconceivable that the
        atmospheric content might be conducive to extremely high
        longevity&mdash;perhaps even immortality?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Carl wanted to say something&mdash;anything. "When&mdash;when were these
        pictures taken?" he finally managed.
      </p>

      <p>"Just a little over four months ago."</p>

      <p>
        The voice had an oddly nostalgic ring to it. Carl turned. The man had
        apparently entered the room unnoticed. He was a big block-shouldered
        man, with brown eyes and a mat of inky-black hair that all but covered a
        low sloping forehead. He could have passed for a cargo hand at the
        Montauk Spaceport, except that Carl knew different.
      </p>

      <p>"No need to introduce myself, is there?" the man said.</p>

      <p>
        Carl shook his head. To Hamlin he said: "Paul Spero just got back from
        Venus too. We were discharged together&mdash;as if you didn't know."
      </p>

      <p>
        "You should have stuck around Keating," Spero said. "Right after you
        left, I tied in with a three-day party. You missed out on a good time."
      </p>

      <p>
        "I'll bet," Carl said. "I take it that you were the one who brought back
        the pictures?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Spero forced a grin that didn't quite make the width of his mouth.
        "That's right. While you and the rest of the crew were entertaining
        yourselves collecting fossils I did some research on my own."
      </p>

      <p>
        "Did it ever occur to you that the military might want these pictures?"
        Carl asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        The other man made a noise with his nose. "Just what did the military
        ever do for me, Keating?" he asked "Fifteen years I spent as a crewman
        on every flame-buggy from here to Titan and back, and after all that, I
        get pensioned off a miserable second lieutenant."
      </p>

      <p>
        "You'll have to admit," Carl said, "there were times when your conduct
        fell something short of exemplary."
      </p>

      <p>
        Spero tossed him a sloppy salute. "Yes, Major," he said with mock
        formality. Abruptly he strode over to where Carl was standing. "I don't
        think you quite get it yet, Keating," he said thickly. "Try using your
        imagination. Forget about the griping we did when we were stationed
        there. It's different now. Edgerton, Mitchell and Rhind have found a way
        to breathe, and the secret of breathing is also the secret of
        immortality. Suppose I'd been sucker enough to turn this information
        over to the high brass? Inside of half-an-hour, those men would have
        been interrogated. Inside of a week, the information would have been
        radioed back to Terra. And by now, every one on this earth and his great
        maiden aunt would be selling their soul to get passage to Venus. And
        where do you think all this would leave us Keating? I'll tell you where
        ... we'd be right here sweating out a priority list long enough to
        stretch from here to Pluto and back!"
      </p>

      <p>
        Carl studied the man's face. "I take it then you didn't talk to these
        men when you took the pictures?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Spero shook his head. "No," he said carefully. "At first I had all I
        could do to keep from running up to them, but then I figured that if
        they saw me, they'd know there was a spaceship on the planet. All kinds
        of things went through my head; one of them was that maybe they were
        sick of Venus and would try to make contact with the ship and spill
        their story. In the end, I just hid behind a clump of saroo trees and
        took the pictures."
      </p>

      <p>
        Carl let his gaze wander about the room. He had to think. Then, almost
        as if it had been prearranged, he found himself looking into a
        full-length mirror on the far wall. The reflection he saw wasn't
        old&mdash;the hair, while slightly lighter at the temples, was still for
        the most part dark-brown. He had a good build too, and except for a few
        creases radiating from the corners of his eyes, his skin had the smooth
        sort of thickness that many men in their middle-thirties would have
        envied. He'd kept himself well. It would probably be fifteen or twenty
        years yet before the almost invisible lines in his cheeks and forehead
        would begin to widen into deep grooves. But it would happen. It
        would....
      </p>

      <p>And it didn't have to.</p>

      <p>
        He knew what the proposition was now. He turned to Dr. Hamlin. "Let's
        see if I have it figured," he said. "You want to go to Venus and look
        for this fountain of youth. Ferguson's financing the trip, and Spero is
        the Ponce de Leon who knows where to look. All you need is a pilot.
        Right?"
      </p>

      <p>
        "Think it over carefully, Mr. Keating," Hamlin said. "Don't be hasty in
        your answer."
      </p>

      <p>
        Spero too had noticed the note of rejection in his voice. "You'd better
        grab the chance, Keating," he said. "Right now I'll admit I don't like
        Venus anymore than you. But we're going to change all that. Right after
        the migration starts there'll be cities, and parks and railroads. And
        we'll be the ones responsible for all of it. We'll be heroes&mdash;not
        just for ten or twenty years, but forever!"
      </p>

      <p>"Did I hear someone say forever?"</p>

      <p>
        The voice had a resonant, almost musical pitch to it. It was deep and
        throaty, more like an adolescent boy's voice than a woman's. She was
        standing at the arched entrance to the library, one hand balanced on the
        jade statue flanking the threshold. She had finespun taffy-blonde hair
        and a complexion to match. She wore a gray-green krylon dress, the same
        color as her eyes. It looked good on her. A space jumper would have
        looked equally well.
      </p>

      <p>
        "I don't believe you've met my daughter," Dr. Hamlin said. "Diane, this
        is Mr. Keating."
      </p>

      <p>
        Diane crossed the room. The pressure of her fingers was quick, and warm
        and suggestive. "Hello, Mr. Keating," she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Carl was aware of mumbling something polite. Across the room, Stewart
        Ferguson had derricked himself out of the chair. Spero remained seated,
        caressing the girl with his sultry brown eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Diane flicked an imaginary wisp of hair back from behind her ear. "Have
        you decided to join us, Mr. Keating?" she said.
      </p>

      <p>"Us?"</p>

      <p>
        She searched his face. "Why, yes. Didn't Dad tell you there'd be five of
        us. After all, who'd want a slice of immortality more than a woman."
      </p>

      <p>"Immortality for a goddess," Ferguson said blandly.</p>

      <p>
        The soft, red mouth twitched almost imperceptibly. Then the brief look
        of annoyance was gone. "You will come, won't you?" she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Keating avoided her eyes. Again he found his gaze wandering to the wall
        mirror; looking at his own face, coarse and ruddy looking against
        Diane's soft white shoulder.
      </p>

      <p>"Count me in," he said quietly.</p>

      <hr class="chap" />

      <p class="ph1">III</p>

      <p>
        Keating opened his eyes slowly, dimly aware of the familiar throbbing
        headache and a dull racking pain around the chest. Hazy-looking behind a
        galaxy of dancing spots was the instrument panel. He shook his head
        sideways&mdash;hard. The spots dissolved and the big panel board jumped
        into focus. The ship was two hundred miles above the Montauk Spaceport.
        He flicked a glance over his shoulder, half expecting to see the
        familiar blue uniforms of his fellow crewmates. Instead he saw three men
        and a girl&mdash;a girl with long shapely legs and taffy-blonde hair.
      </p>

      <p>So it was true then. It hadn't been a dream after all.</p>

      <p>
        After the passengers began to stir, he turned. "Have a nice sleep?" he
        asked.
      </p>

      <p>Diane shot him a pale smile.</p>

      <p>
        Stewart Ferguson pretended to applaud. "Splendid Captain," he said
        contemptuously. "A momentous speech for a momentous occasion. Come, say
        something more for the history books!"
      </p>

      <p>
        There was an awkward silence. Then Spero guffawed. Carl bit off the
        angry reply that jumped to his lips. "All right, I will," he said. "How
        about someone brewing a pot of coffee?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Diane got up and disappeared into the galley. Minutes later, she
        returned with a tray of containers. She stopped momentarily when Spero,
        leaning against one of the ports at the end of the companionway, said
        something to her, then abruptly, she quickened her pace. When she handed
        Carl the coffee her face was a deep scarlet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Carl Keating stared vacantly out of the blister window watching the
        fleecy-white rim of the earth roll up toward them. The trip, less than
        one hour old, was already a hotbed of smoldering emotions. Worst of all,
        was the fact that things were almost sure to get worse before they got
        better. Under the best of conditions, space does strange things to
        individuals cramped together in the confines of a ship. Army records are
        crammed full of case histories where men, failing to adjust themselves
        to existing conditions, have reacted in ways which are probably best
        left in the files. But military men are schooled and conditioned for
        space, and while complete and mutual understanding seldom exists, there
        is usually, even as there was between Spero and himself, an unwritten
        live-and-let-live policy among crew members.
      </p>

      <p>
        But they weren't in the army anymore, and no one seemed more aware of it
        than Paul Spero. Never a model officer, Spero in his new-found freedom,
        had become almost unbearably obnoxious. Nor could he expect any
        cooperation from Stewart Ferguson. He could handle him, he hoped. All of
        which brought him to the big question. What about Diane?
      </p>

      <p>
        It was probably a paradox that while the more unsavory military case
        histories were due to men being without women, the proximity of a
        long-legged taffy-blonde in this case was a factor more conducive to
        mutiny than harmony.
      </p>

      <p>
        And curiously enough, it was Diane Hamlin herself, who came up with at
        least part of the answer. She was smart&mdash;whether or not she'd been
        around was a question to ponder over while staring into the star-studded
        blackness beyond the blister ports. But one thing was certain: the girl
        had an almost uncanny knowledge of the working's of men's minds, an
        insight of psychology which she applied diplomatically if not ruthlessly
        to all aboard.
      </p>

      <p>
        With just the right amount of good-natured tolerance she either ignored
        or subtly evaded the bluntly-pointed remarks of Stewart Ferguson and
        deftly sidestepped the impulsive hands of Paul Spero. On several
        occasions when a crisis seemed imminent, she disappeared&mdash;always
        good-naturedly and on a new logical pretense&mdash;into the small
        cubbyhole to which she'd been assigned. So tactfully was all this
        accomplished that they'd already passed the halfway mark before Carl
        realized that he hadn't spoken to her alone since during the
        preparations.
      </p>

      <hr class="tb" />

      <p>
        He was mildly surprised therefore, when while spelling Spero at the
        controls during the sleep period, he became suddenly aware of someone
        standing at his elbow. She was wearing a robins-egg-blue dressing robe,
        loose-fitting except around the curve of her breasts. She sat down in
        the co-pilot's seat next to him.
      </p>

      <p>"Mind if I keep you company awhile? I can't seem to get to sleep."</p>

      <p>
        "A pleasure," Carl said with genuine enthusiasm.... He stopped
        awkwardly, wondering what to say.... Impulsively, he ran his open hand
        across the width of the blister glass. "Want a hunk of space, baby. Say
        where to cut and I'll slice it for you."
      </p>

      <p>
        She smiled a little. "You sound a little like Ferguson when you talk
        that way."
      </p>

      <p>Carl pretended to check the dials.</p>

      <p>"Carl?"</p>

      <p>On his forearm he could feel Diane's fingers. He turned.</p>

      <p>"What makes a man like that?"</p>

      <p>
        He moved his shoulders. "I don't know, unless it's because he's always
        been able to buy anything he's ever wanted. As far as I know, there's
        only been one thing he hasn't been able to buy, and he's working on
        that."
      </p>

      <p>"You mean immortality?"</p>

      <p>
        Carl ignored the question. "Why ask me about Ferguson's mind anyhow?" he
        asked suddenly. "You're the psychologist of this expedition." He watched
        her nibble on her lower lip for a moment, then went on: "You don't have
        to admit it. I just want you to know you've been doing a good job. I
        don't know how long you can keep it up or what happens after we get to
        Venus, but up till now you've been doing all right. There's only one
        thing wrong with the setup as far as I can see, and that's that this
        arm's-length policy apparently applies to me as well as it does to
        everyone else. I know it's necessary to the plan, and I know it's a
        selfish argument, but it bothers me!"
      </p>

      <p>
        She turned and faced him. For a moment it occurred to him she was angry,
        but when she spoke, her voice was soft, and deep, and lingering. "I'm
        sorry, Carl, but you can see why it has to be this way.... I
        mean&mdash;"
      </p>

      <p>
        Carl leaned over suddenly and kissed her full on the lips. She didn't
        pull away. Neither did she respond the way he'd have liked her to. After
        a brief interval he felt the pressure of her hand against his shoulder.
      </p>

      <p>"Please Carl, not now."</p>

      <p>"When?"</p>

      <p>
        She turned away. On the starboard port he could see the reflection of
        her finely-moulded face. She looked wistful, almost on the verge of
        tears.
      </p>

      <p>
        "I don't know, Carl," she said wearily. "Maybe after we're settled on
        Venus. Maybe after the migration starts."
      </p>

      <p>
        Keating hacked up a laugh. "Just what makes you so sure there's going to
        be a migration, or for that matter any little men who never grow old as
        long as they have their daily diet of ammonia and chlorine?"
      </p>

      <p>
        He watched her turn, felt her eyes bore into him. "You don't believe it,
        do you?"
      </p>

      <p>
        "I'm not sure," Carl said carefully, "I want to believe it, only I've
        listened to so many bug yarns in my time it's probably warped my sense
        of values. The whole thing just sounds too fantastic."
      </p>

      <p>"But the pictures?"</p>

      <p>
        "The pictures were real enough," Carl admitted. "I'd vouch for that.
        It's just that if you'd ever caught a whiff of that stuff like I have,
        you'd know that no one could breathe it and stay alive for sixty
        seconds, much less forever."
      </p>

      <p>"What do you think we'll find?"</p>

      <p>
        Carl shrugged. "Who knows? Maybe the story's true. Sometimes I find
        myself wondering what it would be like to be immortal&mdash;I mean after
        all the willful-wishing's over with, and you get down to thinking about
        it in terms of 'what's-in-it-for-me.' Most of us think of immortality as
        being something we could have on our own terms. But suppose everyone
        were immortal, the way they'll be&mdash;or could be&mdash;after this
        so-called migration starts. How much will people have really changed.
        They'll have just as many problems&mdash;bigger ones in fact, 'cause
        they'll be living on what to me is just about the God-awfulest hunk of
        crud in the galaxy. And the only thing they're getting in the way of
        compensation is the knowledge that these same troubles are going to go
        on forever."
      </p>

      <p>
        She was staring at him now&mdash;attentively with her lips slightly
        parted. "You feel this way, and you still agreed to come," she said
        evenly. "Why?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Carl forced a smile. "Like I said, maybe I can have it on my own terms.
        It's a gamble, but if it pays off it'll be worth it."
      </p>

      <p>Diane got up. "I'd best be getting back," she said.</p>

      <p>
        He watched her till she disappeared around the corner of the
        companionway. Then he fixed his gaze on the marble-sized disc to the
        right of Polaris.
      </p>

      <p>"Immortality, and thou," he murmured.</p>

      <hr class="tb" />

      <p>
        Carl Keating nosed the ship into a standard satellite maneuver, circling
        the planet twice before he cleaved into the unbroken ocean of ammonia
        clouds that shrouded the planet. Then they were falling&mdash;falling
        through a smoky whiteness that boiled against the portholes, settling in
        spots, and condensing into tiny rivulets that ran the length of the
        amber glass. The ship shuddered sharply three times as its powerful
        thrust engines reached out, challenging the herculean fingers of
        gravity; fighting them&mdash;fighting them to a draw. Then the misty
        ports cleared, and the ship settled with a gentle bump in the center of
        a broad meadow.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not till after the controls had been checked, and the atomic reactor
        switch set to recharge, did he look at the passengers. They were
        standing in the companionway, their faces pressed against the ports. He
        crossed the control room and peered over the bony shoulder of Norman
        Hamlin.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dismal-looking, even through the amber glass, the miserable panorama
        rolled away from them. A quarter-mile away, the meadow ended at the rim
        of a small ridge, beyond which a hill dipped down&mdash;down across the
        roof of a purple-brown saroo forest that merged with an abyss of
        swirling green fog that swallowed up the horizon. In the foreground, a
        few packing cases lay scattered about in front of a large white
        hemisphere topped by a radio antenna and American flag. It was all
        there, exactly the way it had been left by the military almost six
        months ago.
      </p>

      <p>
        "That's a permanent building," Carl said to no one in particular. "Just
        before we evacuated, Colonel Brophy stocked it up with all our excess
        supplies, just on the chance someone might be crazy enough to come back
        here. We even left the separator running when we left. So take a good
        look at it, 'cause inside that bubble is the only breath of air on the
        whole planet."
      </p>

      <p>"Very nice of the military," Ferguson commented dryly.</p>

      <p>"Let's hope we won't have to use it long," Dr. Hamlin said.</p>

      <p>
        Carl looked out the port. Rain, that doused the planet almost twenty
        hours a day, had started to fall, settling in small puddles at the base
        of the ship and drenching the broad-leafed saroo trees.
      </p>

      <p>"I wouldn't bet on it," he said.</p>

      <p>
        As if in a trance, Diane continued to stare at the melancholy landscape.
        "It's more that awful color than anything else," she said finally. "It
        makes everything seem so angry looking. How about the rest of the
        planet? Is it all like this?"
      </p>

      <p>
        "No," Carl said, "it's not all like this. That's the trouble. This is
        one of the more livable spots. That's why it was chosen by the military.
        Roughly ten percent of the planet lies above water, but out of that,
        only five percent of the terrain is in the visual belt."
      </p>

      <p>
        "I'll play the straight man," Ferguson said. "Tell us, Captain, what is
        the visual belt?"
      </p>

      <p>
        "The visual belt represents the altitude from approximately three to
        four thousand feet above sea level," Carl told him. "Below that you have
        the green ground haze you see over the tops of those trees, and above it
        is the ten-mile-thick layer of clouds that never lift. Both are so
        thick, that except around the fringe areas, you can't even count your
        own fingers."
      </p>

      <p>
        "Nice place to take your girl for a walk," Ferguson said, looking at
        Diane pointedly.
      </p>

      <p>"Is anyone interested in what I think?" Spero said suddenly.</p>

      <p>"Think away," Carl said. "Who's there to stop you?"</p>

      <p>
        "That's exactly what I'd like to talk about," Spero said grimly. "It
        seems to me that for a fellow who left his rank back at the separation
        center, you've certainly been assuming a lot of authority around here."
      </p>

      <p>
        Carl felt a warm flush rising to his cheekbones. "We've been in space,"
        he said. "The pilot of a ship is responsible for the actions of everyone
        aboard."
      </p>

      <p>
        Spero jerked a thumb at the blister port. "I've got news for you,
        Keating," he said. "We're not IN space anymore, so you may consider
        yourself relieved of your authority. For five weeks now we've watched
        you swagger around the ship like the hero of a grade-B space-opera, and
        frankly I think we're all a little sick of it!"
      </p>

      <p>"Aren't you dramatizing this a little heavy," Diane said suddenly.</p>

      <p>"Shut up!" Spero said harshly.</p>

      <p>
        Stewart Ferguson sat down, folding his hands in his lap. "My, my," he
        said. "A real live mutiny, just like one reads about. Tell me, when does
        Jack Jupiter come crashing through the lock-door?"
      </p>

      <p>
        "I wasn't aware that anyone in particular was in command," Diane
        persisted, "but if you think we need someone, I'd suggest we take a
        vote."
      </p>

      <p>
        Spero grinned. "No, honey. We all know who your money's riding on.
        That's why you can forget all those dreams about you and Keating
        settling down in a saroo covered cottage for the next three or four
        thousand years. You see, I've got different plans."
      </p>

      <p>
        From the slash pocket of his tunic Spero suddenly whipped out a
        snub-nosed needle gun, waving it carelessly across the width of the
        cabin. He flicked a glance at Ferguson.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Surprise," he said. "Jack Jupiter just crashed the lock-door. I'm Jack
        Jupiter!"
      </p>

      <p>"You'll never get away with this," Carl said.</p>

      <p>
        The smile on Spero's face broadened. "Oh, come Keating. How corny can
        you get? I have gotten away with it. Since I'm the only one who can lead
        you to immortality, what's more natural than for me to take command? My
        first official act will be to detail you, Ferguson, and Dr. Hamlin to go
        outside and activate the blister. You'll find space jumpers in the
        airlock. Diane and I will stay here and figure out a plan of action."
      </p>

      <p>
        Carl took a step forward. "I'm afraid we can't go along with your plan,"
        he said quietly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Spero leveled the lethal end of the weapon against his chest. "You're
        acting stupidly, Keating. You know you can't stop me, just as you know
        I'll kill you if you try. You above all people should know that."
      </p>

      <p>
        There was a stagnant silence, during which Carl held his ground.
        Violently he was aware of the beating of his own heart. The tapping got
        louder as he watched Spero's finger tighten on the trigger. Then
        suddenly he realized it wasn't his heart. SOMEONE WAS TAPPING ON THE
        THICK GLASS INSIDE THE CONTROL ROOM.
      </p>

      <p>
        Spero heard it, too. For a confused moment, his trigger-finger relaxed
        as he tried to flick a quick glance toward the source of the sound.
      </p>

      <p>Then the world exploded in his face.</p>

      <hr class="chap" />

      <p class="ph1">IV</p>

      <p>
        Carl left Spero lying on the floor where he dropped him. Stopping only
        to scoop the gun off the floor, he ran to the control room. The tattoo
        on the glass stopped when he entered. A face peered in at him&mdash;a
        face curiously without emotion. It was a hairy-face, except around the
        eyes and mouth, where three patches of yellow skin peeked through,
        giving the appearance of three yellow bull's eyes.
      </p>

      <hr class="chap" />

      <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/illus.jpg" alt="" />
      </div>

      <hr class="chap" />

      <p>
        Carl stared at the creature, fascinated. In his entire stay on Venus,
        never had he observed a chowl at such close range. For perhaps five
        seconds the chowl stared back at him, then quickly bounded off the ship
        and disappeared toward the forest.
      </p>

      <p>
        He turned. Diane, standing at the entrance to the control room was
        regarding him curiously. "They look almost human, don't they?" she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        "They are human," Carl told her. "Humanoid anyhow according to the
        people who are supposed to know about these things. We don't know too
        much about them really. They're so timid, it's a novelty to get within
        half-a-mile of them."
      </p>

      <p>"This one wasn't."</p>

      <p>
        Carl scratched his head. "I know. It's the first time I've ever got that
        close to one. I guess he didn't know what a spaceship was. You notice he
        didn't wait very long after he saw us through the window."
      </p>

      <p>"What are you going to do about Spero?" Diane asked suddenly.</p>

      <p>
        Carl walked over to the gun cabinet where he poked around a moment, then
        returned with the key. "I don't know," he admitted. He placed both hands
        on the girl's shoulders. "Just how much does this immortality really
        mean to you?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Diane appeared to think about it a moment. "I'm not sure. I'm not sure
        at all. Sometimes I find myself wondering if I'm not more interested in
        finding out how it's accomplished than I am in applying it to myself. Do
        you feel that way, too?"
      </p>

      <p>Carl looked out the window.</p>

      <p>"I've always felt that way," he said.</p>

      <hr class="tb" />

      <p>
        Spero, aided by Dr. Hamlin, was just beginning to stir when they
        returned. He shook his head dazedly for a moment, then sat up massaging
        his jaw.
      </p>

      <p>
        Keating regarded him with a questioning stare. "What do you think we
        should do with you?" he asked bluntly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Spero patted his pockets and came up with a cigarette. After it had been
        lighted, he blew the smoke in Carl's direction. "If you were smart,
        you'd kill me," he said. "Only you're not smart. You know you won't, and
        I know you won't. So suppose we all relax and stop trying to build up
        suspense."
      </p>

      <p>
        Carl dropped his hand inside his pocket, allowing his grip to tighten
        around the butt of the needle gun. "What makes you so sure I won't kill
        you?" he said. "I could, you know. The fact you know where Edgerton and
        his cronies are wouldn't stop me. I could probably find them myself if I
        wanted to. And I'm not even sure that I want to."
      </p>

      <p>
        Spero took a drag on the cigarette and derricked himself to his feet. "I
        wasn't thinking of that," he said quietly. "I just happen to know that
        you haven't got it in you to kill a man in cold blood, Keating. I could
        do it but not you. You got too many principles. The worst you could
        bring yourself to do, Keating, would be to put it up to a vote. And if
        it came to that, everyone here&mdash;probably you included&mdash;would
        vote to let me off on the promise that I wouldn't do it again. Go ahead,
        put it to a vote. See if I'm not right."
      </p>

      <p>
        Keating let his eyes wander across the cabin.... To Stewart Ferguson,
        white-looking, and curiously without comment.... To Diane, outraged
        amazement on her face&mdash;but still a woman. And to Norman Hamlin,
        wondering what made the man tick&mdash;but still a doctor. He looked
        back at Spero, blowing small curls of smoke at the ceiling.
      </p>

      <p>No, he didn't have to take a vote.</p>

      <p>
        Impulsively, he waved the gun in the direction of the cubbyhole where
        Diane had been sleeping. "Get in there," he said tightly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Spero stubbed out the cigarette, swiveled a tight-lipped smile across
        each member of the party, then shrugged his shoulders and shuffled into
        the room.
      </p>

      <p>
        Carl locked the door and stuck the key in his pocket along with the key
        to the gun case. While neither of the locks were built for durability,
        at least Spero would have to make a noise opening them.
      </p>

      <p>
        To the others he said: "I'd suggest we make our future plans without
        figuring on Spero's cooperation."
      </p>

      <p>
        "But how can we," Dr. Hamlin said. "We'll have to find Edgerton,
        Mitchell and Rhind first. They're the only ones who know the answer to
        what we're after."
      </p>

      <p>
        "The secret of immortality is nothing more than the secret of breathing
        the air here," Carl said crisply. "Let's not kid ourselves about that."
      </p>

      <p>
        "Well, what is the secret?" Hamlin said impatiently. "I'm sure I haven't
        the slightest idea."
      </p>

      <p>Carl studied the man intently.</p>

      <p>"Haven't you?"</p>

      <p>Diane shot him an odd look.</p>

      <p>"What's that supposed to mean?" Hamlin said hotly.</p>

      <p>
        Keating ignored the question and jerked a finger at the window. "Suppose
        we leave Spero here and go over and activate the blister. It's much more
        comfortable. It'll be a nice change after being cramped up here for six
        weeks."
      </p>

      <p>"Suppose you explain that statement first?" Hamlin said.</p>

      <p>
        "There's jumpers in the airlock," Carl went on. "I'll explain after
        we're settled over there. Who knows, maybe by that time I'll be ready to
        apologize."
      </p>

      <p>
        "I certainly hope so," Hamlin mumbled. "I can't understand what's got
        into everyone all of a sudden."
      </p>

      <p>"This way," Carl said.</p>

      <p>
        Inside the lock, he helped each member of the party into a jumper and
        adjusted the air valves. When everything was in order, he pressed a
        switch, and the lock-door hissed open.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another moment, and they were wading through the purple-brown,
        ankle-deep slosh of Venus. The blister-building was only about three
        hundred yards from the ship, but the rain&mdash;coming down in torrents
        now&mdash;had turned the ground into a soft-slimy ooze that was
        sometimes knee deep.
      </p>

      <p>
        Carl led the way, shouting instructions through the speaker-unit encased
        in his helmet. Once when Diane fell, he went back and helped her to her
        feet. Through the helmet glass, he could see her face for a moment. Then
        she jerked her arm free and plodded on. Behind him he heard Stewart
        Ferguson swear.
      </p>

      <p>
        It took a full twenty minutes to reach the building. It was big. Two
        hundred feet in diameter at the base, it sloped out of the sea of mud
        like a giant stemless mushroom. Carl led the party around the base to
        the far side where the lock-door was situated. Then he stopped.
      </p>

      <p>
        The rest of the party had caught up with him now. They stood in a
        restless semi-circle in front of the great doors. From behind
        mud-splattered face-plates, three pairs of eyes were regarding him
        curiously. He didn't answer their solemn stare. Instead he continued to
        stare at the great lock-doors.
      </p>

      <p>They were open.</p>

      <hr class="tb" />

      <p>
        For a full minute he stared into the darkness, then he touched the
        switch of his helmet lamp. The beam, seemingly thick enough to walk on,
        stabbed into the cave-like interior. He went in. First, he'd have to get
        the pumps working. Then, after the lethal gases had been pumped out,
        start the separator motors. Even then, the place wouldn't be livable for
        three weeks. He swore.
      </p>

      <p>
        Abruptly, from behind him, he became aware of three flickering beams of
        light. Diane and the two men were following him inside. He turned,
        waving his arms backward. "Stay back!" he called. "Wait till I get the
        lights working."
      </p>

      <p>He watched them stop.</p>

      <p>
        And then, the lights WERE working. They came on all at once,
        illuminating the big structure with dazzling brilliancy. From behind
        him, he was aware of the staccato crackle of a squawk-box being readied
        for use. Then, like a bass drum in a brick tunnel, a voice boomed out of
        the stillness:
      </p>

      <p>"Welcome! Welcome to Venus!"</p>

      <p>
        He stepped back, trying to peer over the row of packing cases. The voice
        had originated from the control room at the far end of the building. He
        flinched when something touched the sleeve of his jumper, then relaxed
        when he saw Diane peering at him through a mud-stained face-plate. The
        men had joined him, too, looking at him and shifting from one foot to
        the other.
      </p>

      <p>
        The squawk-box was silent now. Impulsively, Carl allowed his gloved hand
        to brush against the butt of the needle pistol holstered in the
        webbed-belt of his jumper.
      </p>

      <p>"The gun won't be necessary, I assure you. I'm unarmed!"</p>

      <p>
        The speaker stood at the far end of a corridor of wooden cases,
        spotlighted in the glow of an overhead lamp. He was a young man, with
        close-cropped sandy-blonde hair. He wore a blue spaceman's
        uniform&mdash;obviously salvaged from one of the cases.
      </p>

      <p>
        He remained motionless a moment, like a man waiting for the press
        photographers to finish, then walked slowly toward them, his bare hand
        extended in greeting.
      </p>

      <p>"I'm Raymond Edgerton," the man said.</p>

      <p>
        Awkwardly, Carl grasped the bare hand with the thick glove of his
        jumper. "I know," he said. He was suddenly at a loss for words. What DID
        one say at a time like this? Certainly not the time-worn Dr. Livingston
        cliche.
      </p>

      <p>Stewart Ferguson said it anyhow.</p>

      <p>
        Carl studied the man carefully, watching the rise and fall of his
        breathing. The man WAS breathing&mdash;breathing the lethal gases that
        should kill him in thirty seconds.
      </p>

      <p>"You find it hard to believe, don't you?" Edgerton said suddenly.</p>

      <p>
        Carl nodded. "I have a nephew who collects stamps," he heard himself
        saying. "He has one with your picture on it. It's a rarity now, 'cause
        it's almost forty years old, but the picture on the stamp looks just
        like you&mdash;just like you do NOW!"
      </p>

      <p>
        "How is it done Mr. Edgerton?" Diane asked pointedly. "Why is it that
        you can breathe this air when it kills everyone else?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Edgerton's eyes narrowed when he heard the voice. Then he leaned over
        and peered into the mud-stained face-plate. He smiled. "I'll be damned,"
        he said. "A woman. A real live woman! Pretty too."
      </p>

      <p>"How is it done?" Diane persisted.</p>

      <p>
        Edgerton's grin faded. He turned to Carl. "You mean you don't know?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Carl eyed the man, his lips set in an aggravating silence. Then: "Yes, I
        know. Or at least I think I know. Furthermore, Dr. Hamlin knows too.
        He's known all the time. Obviously, this girl is the only one who's
        still in the dark. I think it's about time someone told her."
      </p>

      <p>"Wait!" Dr. Hamlin said.</p>

      <p>
        "Say, what's this all about?" Edgerton said suddenly. "Where's Paul
        Spero anyhow? Rhind and Mitchell are waiting!"
      </p>

      <p>
        Carl flicked a look at Diane, then turned back to her father. "Are you
        going to tell her? Or should I?"
      </p>

      <p>
        "Tell me what?" Diane said. "How does he know about Paul Spero? Spero
        told us...."
      </p>

      <hr class="chap" />

      <p class="ph1">V</p>

      <p>
        "Spero told us a lot of things," Carl said thickly. "He told us he'd
        taken pictures without speaking to anyone. It served his purpose better
        to keep us in the dark about how this immortality thing was really
        worked until after we got here. After that, he figured he'd take over
        and we'd have to go along with him whether we liked it or not.
        Furthermore, Ferguson and your father were in on it from the beginning,
        weren't you?"
      </p>

      <p>
        "Please," Dr. Hamlin said nervously, "it's not near as bad as you're
        making it out to be. It's only a minor adjustment."
      </p>

      <p>
        "Minor adjustment!" Carl grasped the arm of Diane's jumper, pulling her
        along with him through the long corridors of boxes. At the far end of
        the structure, he found what he was searching for. Three
        boxes&mdash;slitted in front like a zoo cage. And inside the boxes,
        peering at them through sad yellow-rimmed eyes&mdash;were three chowls.
      </p>

      <p>
        "There's the answer to your immortality," Carl said grimly. "Rhind and
        Mitchell were both doctors&mdash;surgeons. Do you get it now?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Raymond Edgerton and Norman Hamlin had joined them now. "Mr. Keating,"
        Edgerton said, "I'm sure if you were a doctor, you wouldn't be so
        squeamish about a thing like this. After all, what's a simple
        operation?"
      </p>

      <p>"Simple operation!"</p>

      <p>
        Carl reached over clamping his gloved hands on Edgerton's shoulders.
        Quickly, he raked the steel-tipped fingers of both hands down the man's
        back. There was a tearing noise, as the open-collared shirt ripped apart
        at the seams, revealing a broad fleshy back&mdash;smooth-looking except
        for where an angry gash dipped in a deep U between the shoulder blades.
      </p>

      <p>
        He jerked his thumb back to where the chowls were chattering restlessly
        in their cages. "In case you don't know it," he said, "chowls are
        humanoid. They're the only things on this planet with any sign of
        intelligence. Killing them's not only murder. It's worse than murder.
        It's genocide! All that has to happen is for this story to get back to
        Terra, and you'll have every quack who can wield a scalpel up here
        cutting the lungs out of these poor creatures!"
      </p>

      <p>
        Alongside him, he was aware of Diane getting sick inside her helmet.
        Ferguson coughed.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Since you were apparently aware of this all the time, Keating, just why
        did you come along?" Ferguson asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        "I wasn't aware of it all along. It wasn't till I saw Dr. Hamlin nursing
        Spero's jaw that I began to wonder why he wanted a doctor along in the
        first place. He needed you to finance the trip, and he needed me to
        pilot the ship. But why Dr. Hamlin unless there was some need for a
        surgeon? Then I remembered the chowls, and everything began to fall into
        place."
      </p>

      <p>
        Ferguson sat down on one of the wooden cases. "As usual Keating, you're
        not being very logical. As a matter of fact, he didn't need the good
        doctor at all. He had two doctors right here. Remember?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Carl nodded. "Yes, I remember," he said grimly. "That was the part of
        the puzzle that didn't fit. But now I think I've even got the answer to
        that."
      </p>

      <p>"Do tell?"</p>

      <p>
        "Yes, I'll tell you," Carl said ruthlessly. "It was because with all the
        build-up these would-be-gods gave you about this immortality gimmick,
        they were sick to death of it. They were sick of the loneliness, sick of
        the rain, sick of the color of purple. In short, they were sick of this
        foul planet and were willing to trade it in for whatever the earth had
        to offer them! That's where Dr. Hamlin came in."
      </p>

      <p>
        Doggedly, Carl spun on Edgerton, trying to draw the tatters of his shirt
        back across his back.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Who's lungs were you going to take, Mr. Edgerton? Mine, or Stewart
        Ferguson's?"
      </p>

      <p>
        He was aware of Diane pulling on his arm. He turned to the two men in
        the mud-splattered jumpers. "We're leaving for Terra in an hour," he
        said crisply. "Are you coming, or staying?"
      </p>

      <p>Ferguson and Hamlin stared at each other.</p>

      <p>"Make up your mind!"</p>

      <p>
        Abruptly, Dr. Hamlin walked over to where Diane was standing. "I'm an
        old man," he said. "All I have back on Earth is twenty years at the
        most. Stay with me, Diane?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Breathlessly, Carl watched the girl&mdash;watched her shake her head,
        slowly. "How about you?" he asked Ferguson.
      </p>

      <p>
        For a long moment, Ferguson appeared undecided. Then he looked at Dr.
        Hamlin. "I'm in trouble back home," he mumbled. "Bad trouble. They're
        going to find out about it any day, if they haven't found out
        already.... I&mdash;I'd better stay."
      </p>

      <hr class="tb" />

      <p>
        With Diane grasping his arm, Carl started down the long corridor of
        packing cases toward the open lock-door.
      </p>

      <p>
        "I'm sorry it turned out this way," he said. "As soon as we ready the
        ship I'll go back and talk to them again. Maybe they'll change their
        minds."
      </p>

      <p>
        Diane didn't answer. Instead she turned a last backward glance toward
        her father. It was a long glance. Too long. He was aware of her
        steel-tipped fingers digging into the sleeve of his jumper. He wheeled.
        Ten feet away, standing in a niche between the wooden cases, was a man.
        He wore a regulation space jumper and helmet, and was regarding them
        curiously over the barrel of a Westinghouse-chain-rifle. The man spoke:
      </p>

      <p>"I'm interrupting something, I hope," he said evenly.</p>

      <p>The man was Paul Spero.</p>

      <p>Carl eyed the man warily. Diane choked out a heavy gasp.</p>

      <p>
        "You should have killed me back in the ship like I suggested," Spero
        said smugly. "Now I'm going to have to kill you instead."
      </p>

      <p>
        Carl flicked a quick look at Diane. "What about her? Are you planning to
        kill her too?"
      </p>

      <p>
        The overhead light sparkled briefly across the rifle barrel as Spero
        snapped the weapon to his shoulder. Across the sights he said: "Diane
        will stay here with me. That's the way I planned it and that's how it'll
        be."
      </p>

      <p>
        "I know I'm interfering with your plans," Carl said with mock-concern,
        "but I don't think she is. Not unless she wants to of course."
      </p>

      <p>
        From behind the face-plate, Spero flashed a double row of teeth. "Stop
        stalling for time, Keating. You had your chance on the ship, and you
        muffed it. Now it's my turn!"
      </p>

      <p>
        Carl waited&mdash;waited while Spero's gloved hand tightened against the
        trigger-switch. The bolt coil snapped back. There was a dull
        click&mdash;nothing else....
      </p>

      <p>
        "Did you really think I'd be stupid enough to leave you alone with a
        case full of live guns?" Keating said thinly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bewildered, Spero snapped the rifle down to chest level, fumbling
        awkwardly with the trigger assembly.
      </p>

      <p>
        "It won't work," Carl said indulgently. "Before we left the ship I
        removed the anodes from every gun in the case. It's an old army trick,
        in case you haven't heard."
      </p>

      <p>
        With Spero glaring at him, Carl allowed his arm to brush against his own
        needle gun. He didn't bother to draw.
      </p>

      <p>"I think your friends are waiting for you," he said.</p>

      <p>
        Back in the control room, Carl went through the motions of readying the
        ship for take-off. Back in the galley he could hear Diane sobbing
        softly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Idly, he glanced out of the amber blister ports toward the big
        sphere-like structure that rose out of the sea of purple mud. It looked
        evil, and ominous-looking against the rain-sodden backdrop of the saroo
        forest.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then from the edge of the tree line, moving shapes suddenly began to
        make an appearance. He rubbed his eyes. There were hundreds&mdash;no,
        thousands of them. Slowly and curiously they poured out of the
        rain-soaked forest, deliberately converging on the open lock-doors of
        the huge, white building. Some were carrying sticks, some stones, some
        nothing. It was as if the mystic forces of evolution had chosen this
        exact moment to endow the chowls with an emotion hitherto lacking in
        their makeup. Call it hate; call it self-preservation; call it anything
        you like, it was something they hadn't had before, yet needed badly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Quickly, he bit off the half-formed cry that rose to his throat. Diane
        was still back in the galley. He was glad she wasn't watching. Actually
        there was no need for her to know about it ever.
      </p>

      <p>
        Silently he made a vow never to tell her&mdash;even as a few moments ago
        they'd both vowed to keep another secret: The secret that could spell
        the life or death of an entire planet.

    <div style="display: block; margin: 1em 0">
      Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
      electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
      including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because
      of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all
      walks of life.
    </div>

    <div style="display: block; margin: 1em 0">
      Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance
      they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s goals
      and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will remain
      freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg
      Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent
      future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future generations. To learn more
      about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your
      efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation

      Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
      Archive Foundation
    </div>

    <div style="display: block; margin: 1em 0">
      Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without
      widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
      increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
      freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array
      of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to
      $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with
      the IRS.
    </div>

    <div style="display: block; margin: 1em 0">
      The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
      charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.
      Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable
      effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these
      requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not
      received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or
      determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit
      <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
    </div>

    <div style="display: block; margin: 1em 0">
      While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have
      not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against
      accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us
      with offers to donate.
    </div>

    <div style="display: block; margin: 1em 0">
      International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
      statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the
      United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
    </div>

    <div style="display: block; margin: 1em 0">
      Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
      and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including
      checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please

      works
    </div>

    <div style="display: block; margin: 1em 0">
      Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
      Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
      freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed
      Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer
      support.
    </div>

    <div style="display: block; margin: 1em 0">
      Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
      editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the
      U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily
      keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
